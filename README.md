# Predicting Ratings from Mystery-Thriller-Crime Goodreads Reviews

This project aims to predict star ratings using user-item interactions and sentiment analysis on 150,000 Mystery-Thriller-Crime Goodreads reviews. 
The model contains features, such as user’s average rating, book’s proportion of ratings, and TF-IDF on 1000 most common N-grams. The project also experiments with other heuristics including use of Cosine and Jaccard similarity and Item2Vec book representations.
